# Class Overview

The Studio 1 class primarily focused on experimenting with Alice Software and Adobe Products such as PhotoShop and After Effects.
Most of the coding was dragging preset code into block code. I was hoping for more practice with coding, but I got that practice when I was in Programming 2.

# Projects 
### Alice Practice
+ Project Summary
  - The project demonstrated my basic understanding of the Alice software. I used block coding to create the scenario and tested it to make sure it was what I wanted.
  - I coded a variable, an if statement with Math Operations, and a loop.
+ Technology Used
  - Alice 3.7

### Degree Discussion
+ Project Summary
  - This project provided more practice for the Alice Software. The code in the file is much simpler, with most of the code being text along with movement. 
+ Technology Used
  - Alice 3.7

### Obstacle Course Game
+ Project Summary
  - The project tested my abilties and knowledge with the Alice Software. I made a game that made the player avoid obstacles while trying to get to the end. It includes checkpoints, a custom camera angle, and loops. The player gets reset to the start or the nearest checkpoint when they hit an obstacle.

 ### Adobe Products Projects
***Due to the file size of my other projects, I was only able to upload one of the projects, the Photoshop image.***
 + Project Summary
  - The projects gave me more practice with working with Adobe Products. I was taking a class at the time that heavily used Adobe Products, so these projects gave me more practice.
  - I had the most trouble with After Effects because it was confusing to use and difficult to learn.
+ Technology Used
  - Adobe Photoshop
  - Adobe Illustrator
  - Adobe After Effects
+ References
  - Professor Genereux
  - Knowledge from another class involving the Adobe Products
  - YouTube Videos

 ### Portfolio
 + Project Summary
  - I created a portfolio for all of my past and future work with programming. The resource used, digication, made it easy to create pages and design them.
+ Technology Used
  - Digication
  - Canvas

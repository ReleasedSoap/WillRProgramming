# Class Overview

The Studio 1 class primarily focused on experimenting with Alice Software and Adobe Products such as PhotoShop and After Effects.
Most of the coding was dragging preset code into block code. I was hoping for more practice with coding, but I got that practice when I was in Programming 2.
